    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Writeup / README\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. You can use this template as a guide for writing the report. The submission includes the project code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're reading it! and here is a link to my [project code](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Set Summary & Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the numpy library (shape function) to calculate summary statistics of the traffic data set.\n",
    "Data set summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The size of training set is **34799**\n",
    "* The size of the validation set is **4410**\n",

    "* The shape of a traffic sign image is **32x32x3**\n",
    "* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is **43**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.\n",
    "I plotted a random image of each class using matplotlib functions. I've also plotted a histogram of the training and validation set. The results are shown below.  \n",

    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "##### Grayscaling  \n",
    "As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because it reduces the complexity of the image. With 3 RGB channels, a more complex model architecture will be needed. Since the signs can be distinguished just by features alone, a grayscale image is preferrable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a traffic sign image before and after grayscaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Normalising  \n",
    "As a last step, I normalized the image data because it ensures that the data is on the same scale.    \n",
    "**Before**    \n",
    "Mean of train set: 82.677589037  \n",
    "Mean of valid set: 83.5564273756  \n",
    "**After**  \n",
    "Normalized mean of train set: -0.354081335648  \n",
    "Normalized mean of valid set: -0.347215411128  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Resampling\n",
    "I decided to generate additional data because when I played around with different architectures, I couldn't achieve any higher accuracy than 0.93. I researched ways to improve the accuracy, and resampling was one of the ways. When I looked at the training set histogram, I saw that some classes were underepresented (or too low). Hence, I generated additional data by creating altered copies of the current samples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To add more data to the the data set, I altered existing images by tilting, zooming, rotating and translating. This was done by using OpenCV functions.  \n",

    "\n",
    "##### New Data Set\n",
    "If the samples for a particular class were less than 250, new samples for that class would be generated until the number is 4 times as much.  \n",
    "The samples with fewer than 500 samples were multiplied by 2.  \n",
    "Other samples sizes remained the same.  \n",

    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* Validation set accuracy of **0.969**\n",
    "* Test set accuracy of **0.921**\n",
    "\n",
    "If an iterative approach was chosen:\n",
    "* At first I tried the suggested LeNet structure and it a gave decent result of 0.890 accuracy.\n",
    "* The accuracy wasn't sufficient for this project, hence I tried adding an additional convolutional layer, and an additional fully connected layer. The accuracy of this model was around 0.92.\n",
    "* I then decided to try out the suggested architecture provided in the [paper](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf). I copied the model archtecture displayed by the figure 2 and it gave an accuracy of somewhere close to 0.93. I tried changing different parameters, like changing batch size and the number of epochs, but it couldn't surpass the 0.93 threshold. Hence, I decided to add more samples to the training and validation set. This improved the accuracy significantly to where it is now.\n",

    "#### 1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.\n",

    "\n",
    "Initially I cropped the images so that sign occupied the whole image. However, it gave a poor performance of 0.4 accuracy. Hence, I had to recrop the images so that there is some margin on the sides. To ensure that the model can classify the signs correctly, next time more zoomed in images should be generated to prevent this issue.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The road works sign seems to be hard for the model to classify. It could be due to a patch of dirt on it which isn't visible (now that it has been resized). It also appears to me that the images are having some noise on it due to the jpeg format, and the quality of the image seems to be worse when compared to the provided data set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set.
